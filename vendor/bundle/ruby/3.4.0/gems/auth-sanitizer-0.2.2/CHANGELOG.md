## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-18

- TAG: [v0.2.2][0.2.2t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 145/145 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Changed

- Documented the released `anonymous_loader` gem as the preferred reusable
  helper for zero-`auth-sanitizer`-namespace loading.

### Fixed

- Documented the `$LOAD_PATH` fallback needed by isolated loader consumers when
  Bundler standalone setup provides `auth_sanitizer/loader.rb` without a
  matching `Gem.loaded_specs` or `GEM_PATH` entry.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-06

- TAG: [v0.2.1][0.2.1t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 145/145 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Fixed

- Removed the duplicate RBS declaration for `Auth::Sanitizer::VERSION`, fixing
  `RBS::DuplicatedDeclarationError` in downstream projects.
- Fixed the README support table to list Ruby 2.3 as supported but untested,
  matching the current runtime support and CI policy.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

- TAG: [v0.2.0][0.2.0t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 145/145 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Changed

- Changed `FilteredAttributes#inspect` to redact narrow patterns from
  `super.inspect` instead of rebuilding object inspect output, preserving host
  inspect behavior.

### Fixed

- Redacted configured attributes inside standard Ruby hash inspect fragments,
  including nested attribute hashes.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-03

- TAG: [v0.1.5][0.1.5t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 138/138 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Added

- Added `VersionGem::Basic` helpers to `Auth::Sanitizer::Version`.

### Changed

- Refreshed generated package metadata, support documentation, CI workflows,
  and development dependency floors from the current kettle-jem template.
- Documented that CI workflows and appraisals now target MRI Ruby 2.4+ while
  runtime compatibility remains MRI Ruby 2.2+.

### Fixed

- Prevented isolated loader namespace leakage on Ruby 2.5 and older TruffleRuby runtimes.
- Protected the custom gemspec version loader from templating rewrites so
  version detection does not define top-level `Auth` on older Rubies.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-21

- TAG: [v0.1.4][0.1.4t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 135/135 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Changed

- (docs) Document constrained `auth-sanitizer` version lookup for isolated loader examples
- (dev) Make templating dependencies opt-in for the main `Gemfile`

### Fixed

- (test) Stop running Appraisal install steps in the locked-deps workflow for the main `Gemfile`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-20

- TAG: [v0.1.3][0.1.3t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 135/135 lines in 6 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 6 files
- 84.62% documented

### Added

- Add `AuthSanitizer::Loader.load_isolated` for isolated loading without defining top-level `Auth`
- Document zero-top-level-namespace loading for consumers that need to avoid defining `Auth` or `AuthSanitizer`

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-15
